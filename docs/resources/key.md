# gpg_key (Resource)

A resource for generating ECC (Curve25519) GPG keys


!>The private key and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in
state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    gpg = {
      source = "terraform-provider-gpg/gpg"
    }
  }
}

resource "gpg_key" "this" {
  identities = [{
    name  = "John Doe"
    email = "john.doe@example.com"
  }]
  passphrase = "topsecret"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `identities` (Attributes List) List of identities for the GPG key. Due to limitations in the underlying library only one identity is supported at the moment. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--identities))
- `passphrase` (String, Sensitive) Passphrase for locking the key.

### Read-Only

- `fingerprint` (String) Fingerprint of the key.
- `id` (String) ID of the key in hex format.
- `private_key` (String, Sensitive) Private key in armored format.
- `private_key_hex` (String, Sensitive) Private key in hex format.
- `public_key` (String) Public key in armored format.
- `public_key_hex` (String) Public key in hex format.

### Nested Schema for `identities`

Required:

- `email` (String) Email
- `name` (String) Name

**Notes:**
- Changing **any** field forces a new resource to be created.

## Import

This resource does not support importing existing gpg keys into state.
